# I am Vincent

I am a 16 y/o programmer having created software in Rust, Elixir, JS/TS, Go, and more. I'm usually inactive on social media nowadays, but I still do programming every now and then.

My main projects are...

### Derailed

A chat app designed to be sleek, minimal, and fast.

### Metal

A programming language made for programs which don't need the complexities Rust, but don't want the nastiness of Go.
